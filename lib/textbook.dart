  "===== Page 4 =====\nChemistry - IX 2 Unit 1: Fundamentals of Chemistry\n## Introduction\nThe knowledge that provides understanding of this world and how it works, is science. The branch of science which deals with the composition, structure, properties and reactions of matter is called chemistry. It deals with every aspect of our life.\nThe development of science and technology has provided us a lot of facilities in daily life. Imagine the role and importance of petrochemical products, medicines and drugs, soap, detergents, paper, plastics, paints and pigments, insecticides, pesticides which all are fruit of the efforts of chemists. The development of chemical industry has also generated toxic wastes, contaminated water and polluted air around us. On the other hand, chemistry also provides knowledge and techniques to improve our health and environment and to explore and to conserve the natural resources.\nIn this chapter, we will study about different branches of chemistry, basic definitions and concepts of chemistry.\n### 1.1 BRANCHES OF CHEMISTRY\nIt is a fact that we live in the world of chemicals. We all depend upon different living organisms which require water, oxygen or carbon dioxide for their survival. Today chemistry has a wide scope in all aspects of life and is serving the humanity day and night. Chemistry is divided into following main branches: physical chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, industrial chemistry, nuclear chemistry, environmental chemistry and analytical chemistry.\n#### 1.1.1 Physical Chemistry\nPhysical Chemistry is defined as the _branch of chemistry that deals with the relationship between the composition and physical properties of matter along with the changes in them_. The properties such as structure of atoms or formation of molecules behavior of gases, liquids and solids and the study of the effect of temperature or radiation on matter are studied under this branch.\n#### 1.1.2 Organic Chemistry\nOrganic Chemistry is the study of _covalent compounds of carbon and hydrogen (hydrocarbons) and their derivatives_. Organic compounds occur naturally and are also synthesized in the laboratories. Organic chemists determine the structure and properties of these naturally occurring as well as synthesized compounds. Scope of this branch covers petroleum, petrochemicals and pharmaceutical industries.\n#### 1.1.3 Inorganic Chemistry\nInorganic chemistry _deals with the study of all elements and their compounds except those of compounds of carbon and hydrogen (hydrocarbons) and their derivatives_. It has applications in every aspect of the chemical industry such as glass, cement, ceramics and metallurgy (extraction of metals from ores).",

  "===== Page 5 =====\nChemistry - IX 3 Unit 1: Fundamentals of Chemistry\n**1.1.4 Biochemistry**\nIt is the branch of chemistry in which we study the structure, composition, and\n_chemical reactions of substances found in living organisms. It covers all chemical\nprocesses taking place in living organisms, such as synthesis and metabolism of\nbiomolecules like carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Biochemistry emerged as a separate\ndiscipline when scientists began to study how living things obtain energy from food or\nhow the fundamental biological changes occur during a disease. Examples of\napplications of biochemistry are in the fields of medicine, food science and agriculture,\netc.\n**1.1.5 Industrial Chemistry**\nThe _branch of chemistry that deals with the manufacturing of chemical\n_compounds on commercial scale, is called industrial chemistry. It deals with the\nmanufacturing of basic chemicals such as oxygen, chlorine, ammonia, caustic soda,\nnitric acid and sulphuric acid. These chemicals provide the raw materials for many other\nindustries such as fertilizers, soap, textiles, agricultural products, paints and paper, etc.\n**1.1.6 Nuclear Chemistry**\nNuclear Chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the radioactivity,\n_nuclear processes and properties. The main concern of this branch is with the atomic\nenergy and its uses in daily life. It also includes the study of the chemical effects resulting\nfrom the absorption of radiation within animals, plants and other materials. It has vast\napplications in medical treatment (radiotherapy), preservation of food and generation of\nelectrical power through nuclear reactors, etc.\n**1.1.7 Environmental Chemistry**\nIt is the branch of chemistry in which we study about components of the\nenvironment and the effects of human activities on the environment. Environmental\nchemistry is related to other branches like biology, geology, ecology, soil and water. The\nknowledge of chemical processes taking place in environment is necessary for its\nimprovement and protection against pollution.\n**1.1.8 Analytical Chemistry**\nAnalytical chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with separation and\n_analysis of a sample to identify its components. The separation is carried out prior to\nqualitative and quantitative analysis. Qualitative analysis provides the identity of a\nsubstance (composition of chemical species). On the other hand, quantitative analysis\ndetermines the amount of each component present in the sample. Hence, in this branch\ndifferent techniques and instruments used for analysis are studied. The scope of this\nbranch covers food, water, environmental and clinical analysis.",

Which branch of chemistry deals with the structure and properties of naturally occurring molecules?\nTest yourself 1.1\n1.2 BASIC DEFINITIONS\nMatter is simply defined as anything that has mass and occupies space. Our bodies as well as all the things around us are examples of matter. In chemistry, we study all types of matters that can exist in any of three physical states: solid, liquid or gas.\nA piece of matter in pure form is termed as a substance. Every substance has a fixed composition and specific properties or characteristics. Whereas, impure matter is called a mixture; which can be homogeneous or heterogeneous in its composition.\nWe know that every substance has physical as well as chemical properties. The properties those are associated with the physical state of the substance are called physical properties like colour, smell, taste, hardness, shape of crystal, solubility, melting or boiling points, etc. For example, when ice is heated, it melts to form water. When water is further heated, it boils to give steam. In this entire process only the physical states of water change whereas its chemical composition remains the same.\nThe chemical properties depend upon the composition of the substance. When a substance undergoes a chemical change, its composition changes and a new substances are formed. For example, decomposition of water is a chemical change as it produces hydrogen and oxygen gases. All materials are either a substance or a mixture. Figure 1.1 shows simple classification of the matter into different forms.\nMATTER\nMixture Substance\nHomogeneous mixture Heterogeneous mixture Elements Compounds\nFig. 1.1.

  "===== Page 7 =====\nChemistry - IX    5    Unit 1: Fundamentals of Chemistry\n1.2.1 Elements, Compounds and Mixtures\n1.2.1.1 Elements\nIn the early ages, only nine elements (carbon, gold, silver, tin, mercury, lead, copper, iron and sulphur) were known. At that time, it was considered that elements were the substances that could not be broken down into simpler units by ordinary chemical processes. Until the end of nineteenth century, sixty-three elements had been discovered. Now 118 elements have been discovered, out of which 92 are naturally occurring elements. Modern definition of element is that it is a substance made up of same type of atoms, having same atomic number and cannot be decomposed into simple substances by ordinary chemical means. It means that each element is made up of unique type of atoms that have very specific properties.\nElements occur in nature in free or combined form. All the naturally occurring elements found in the world have different percentages in the earth's crust, oceans and atmosphere. Table 1.1 shows natural occurrence in percentage by weight of some major elements around us. It shows concentrations of these major elements found in the three main systems of our environment.\nTable 1.1 Natural Occurrences by Weight % of Some Major Elements\n| Earth’s crust | Oceans    | Atmosphere    |\n|---|---|---|\n| Oxygen    | 47 %    | Oxygen    | 86 %    | Nitrogen    | 78 %    |\n| Silicon    | 28 %    | Hydrogen    | 11 %    | Oxygen    | 21 %    |\n| Aluminium    | 7.8 %    | Chlorine    | 1.8 %    | Argon    | 0.9 %    |\nElements may be solids, liquids or gases. Majority of the elements exist as solids e.g. sodium, copper, zinc, gold, etc. There are very few elements which occur in liquid state e.g. mercury and bromine. A few elements exist as gases e.g. nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine and hydrogen.",

  "===== Page 8 =====\n**Chemistry - IX**\n6\nUnit 1: Fundamentals of Chemistry\nMajor part of a living body is made up of water i.e. 65% to 80% by mass.\nSix elements constitute about 99% of our body mass; namely:\nOxygen 65 %, Carbon 18%, Hydrogen 10 %, Nitrogen 3%,\nCalcium 1.5% and Phosphorus 1.5%.\nPotassium, Sulphur, Magnesium and Sodium constitute 0.8% of\nour body mass. Whereas Copper, Zinc, Fluorine, Chlorine, Iron,\nCobalt and Manganese constitute only 0.2% of our body mass.\nElements are represented by symbols, which are abbreviations for the name of\nelements. A symbol is taken from the name of that element in English, Latin, Greek or\nGerman. If it is one letter, it will be capital as H for Hydrogen, N for Nitrogen and C for\nCarbon etc. In case of two letters symbol, only first letter is capital e.g. Ca for Calcium,\nNa for Sodium and Cl for Chlorine.\nThe unique property of an element is valency. It is combining capacity of an\nelement with other elements. It depends upon the number of electrons in the outermost\nshell.\nIn simple covalent compounds, valency is the number of hydrogen atoms which\ncombine with one atom of that element or the number of bonds formed by one atom of\nthat element e.g. in the following compounds.\nH H\nI I\nH—Cl, H—O—H, N—H and H—C—H\nI I\nH H\nThe valency of chlorine, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon is 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.\nIn simple ionic compounds valency is the number of electrons gained or lost by\nan atom of an element to complete its octet. Elements having less than four electrons in\ntheir valence shell; prefer to lose the electrons to complete their octet. For example,\natoms of Na, Mg and Al have 1, 2 and 3 electrons in their valence shells respectively.\nThey lose these electrons to have valency of 1, 2 and 3, respectively. On the other hand,\nelements having five or more than five electrons in their valence shells, gain electrons to\ncomplete their octet. For example, N, O and Cl have 5, 6 and 7 electrons in their valence\nshells respectively. They gain 3, 2 and 1 electrons respectively to complete their octet.\nHence, they show valency of 3, 2 and 1, respectively. A radical is a group of atoms that\nhave some charge. Valencies of some common elements and radicals are shown in Table\n1.2.",

For example, in ferrous sulphate (FeSO\(_4\)) the valency of iron is 2. In ferric sulphate (Fe\(_2\)(SO\(_4\))\(_3\)), the valency of iron is 3. Generally, the Latin or Greek name for the element (e.g., Ferrum) is modified to end in 'ous' for the lower valency (e.g. Ferrous) and to end in 'ic' for the higher valency (e.g. Ferric).\n1.2.1.2 Compound\nCompound is a substance made up of two or more elements chemically combined together in a fixed ratio by mass.
